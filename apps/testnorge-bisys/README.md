# testnorge-bisys
Manages the creation of synthetic test data for Bisys.

### MapStruct
MapStruct is utilized for mapping between different Java Bean formats. MapStruct processing requires that an implementation class is available
under /target/generated-sources/annotations/. The implementation class is auto generated by mapstruct-processor during <i>mvn clean install</i>.
Re-run mvn clean install if you get an error saying "Cannot find implementation for no.nav.registre.bisys.consumer.ui.TestnorgeToBisysMapper".
